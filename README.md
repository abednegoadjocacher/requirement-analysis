# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements

# What is Requirement Analysis?
- Requirement analysis is all about understanding what software is supposed to do and the constraints it must operate within
- Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform
    __Why is this important?__
_Because getting this phase right means avoiding costly mistakes later on. If the foundation is weak or misaligned, everything built on it can crumble._
# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
 - _**Prioritization**_: It determines the order of which feature should be develop fisrt.
 - _**Clarity and Understanding**_: It helps in understanding what the - stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
 - _**Scope Definition**_: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
 - _**Basis for Design and Development**_: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
 - _**Cost and Time Estimation**_: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
 - _**Quality Assurance**_: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

 # Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. ### __Requirement Gathering__
    - __Interviews__: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
    - __Surveys/Questionnaires__: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
    - __Workshops__: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
    - __Observation__: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
    - __Document Analysis__: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
2. ### __Requirement Elicitation__
    - __Brainstorming__: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
    - __Focus Groups__: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
    - __Prototyping__: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
3. ### __Requirement Documentation__
    - __Requirement Specification Document__: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
    - __User Stories__: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.
    - __Use Cases__: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
4. ### __Requirement Analysis and Modeling__
    - __Requirement Prioritization__: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
    - __Feasibility Analysis__: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
    - __Modeling__: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
5. ### __Requirement Validation.__
    - __Review and Approval__: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
    - __Acceptance Criteria__: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
    - __Traceability__: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
# Types of Requirements
- ## Functional Requirements
    - _Functional requirements_ are product features that developers must implement to enable the users to achieve their goals. They define the basic system behavior under specific conditions.  __OR__ It describes what the system should do
    - _Examples for the booking management_
        - __User authentication__: Secure login and registration process for users. 
        - __Property search__: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
        - __Booking system__: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings
        - __User registration__: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
- ## Non-functional Requirements 
    - _Non-functional requirements_ are system qualities that guide the design of the solution and often serve as constraints across the relevant backlogs.__OR__ It describes how the system should perform
    - _Examples for the booking management_
        - __Maintainability__: How easy it is to update and modify the system
        - __Performance__: The system should load pages within 3 seconds and handle up to 2000 concurrent users.
        - __Security__: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities
        - __Usability__: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
# Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams gives visual representation of interactions between users and the system.
Therefore, use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
## Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
- Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
